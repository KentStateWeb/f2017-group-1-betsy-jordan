  </h1>Events</h1>

  <p>Like wine, there are so many varieties of coffee that tasting them
    all can be somewhat overwhelming. Guided Tastings allow you to experience
    the flavor characteristics of a particular coffee and compare it to
    another coffee from the same or different growing region or processing
    method. Gain a rounded experience with the featured coffee or tea and
    learn the nuances of taste from each blend.Every Saturday we invite you
    to AROMA to experience a guided tasting of our special featured coffees
    and teas. And during each tasting event, you will receive 15% off on all
    coffees, teas and equipment featured.</p>
