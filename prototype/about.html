  <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>For over ten years we have sourced, roasted, blended and served our award winning coffee to Ohio. We offer a variety of estate and co-op coffees as well as a few select and specialized blends. We value the importance of fairness and quality at each step of the process from seed to cup. We also offer a selection of coffee-related supplies and equipment that we endorse. For more information about our coffee roasting, wholesale programs and buy our beans, visit our <a href="">wholesale store.</a></p>

  <h2>The Art of Coffee</h2>
  <p>Our batch size (20-30 lbs. per batch) is small enough to give us good control and flexibility with our roast profile, and large enough to give a good amount of bean-to-bean radiant heat transfer and roast evenness. We exclusively air-cool our beans because water-quenching degrades flavor intensity and clarity. Roasting coffee to perfection is exciting, but not mysterious. Here’s how we do it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Travel the globe to find the best coffee beans.</l1>
      <li> Buy entire micro-lots of great beans at a fair price.</li>
      <li> Roast with artistry and advanced technology.</li>
      <li> Control quality from grower to roaster to barista to consumer.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Smaller is Better</h2>
  <p>Many of our specialty beans come from a single farm or even from a specific area on the farm, so they are limited in quantity and superior in quality. We buy directly from the farmers and have established strong, long-term relationships, based on good coffee and fair prices.</p>
